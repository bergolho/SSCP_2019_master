    "Tissue is perfused by arteries, arterioles and capillaries ranging between 10 um and 1 mm in diameter, resulting in inhomogeneous porosity. To account for this inhomogeneous porosity we expand Darcy's law to a multi-compartment model using $N$ porous tissues that are superimposed in the model domain.\n",
