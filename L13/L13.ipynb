The arteries supplying tissue branch into thousands of small arteries, arterioles and capillaries that are impossible to capture using modern imaging techniques.

    "Darcy's law itself is a stationary problem (no time dependence). However, in mechanics applications, and for biological systems in particular, we are most often interested in solving time-dependent problems. Darcy's law becomes time-dependent when either $p_D$ or $f(x)$ (or both!) are functions of time. In this case, each timestep is solved as a stationary sub-problem, while $p_D$ and/or $f(x)$ are updated at the beginning of each timestep. We can thus easily expand our code for solving Darcy's law.\n",
