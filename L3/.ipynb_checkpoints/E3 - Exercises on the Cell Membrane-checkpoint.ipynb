While this is a gross simplification of how sodium channels work, it is actually produces an action potential that is phenomenologically quite correct. At least for neuronal action potentials which last on the order of milliseconds. In cardiac cells, action potentials last for a few hundred milliseconds. You will understand why this is the case better when we get further in the course."
