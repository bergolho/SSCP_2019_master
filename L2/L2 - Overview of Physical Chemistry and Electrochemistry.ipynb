    "## The Law of Mass Action\n",
    "\n",
    "The first topic we cover is the *law of mass action*, which is used to model the rate of  chemical reactions. It is one of the fundamental concepts in chemistry.\n",
    "We want to model a chemical reaction. Let us use the combustion of hydrogen gas as an example:\n",
    "$$2\\mathrm{H_2} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\overset{k}{\\longrightarrow} 2\\, \\mathrm{H_2O}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reaction will occur spontaneously, because the resulting product of the reaction has a lower chemical energy than the original reactants. However, the reaction doesn't happen instantaneously, but at a certain *rate*, the question we will answer is *how fast*. The reaction rate is limited because there is a small energy barrier the reactants have to overcome before they can combine and release their energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/activation_barrier.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a physical model of the reaction, think of a mixture of the two gases as a large number of their basic molecules zipping around at high speeds. A single reaction can only occur when there is a collision of all reactants with sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier. For our example, this means two hydrogen molecules and a single oxygen molecule must all collide simultaneously. But how often does such a collision occur? Well, while their molecular motion is random and chaotic, it is reasonable to assume that the probability, and thus the rate of, such collisions to be proportional to their concentrations. Using square brackets to denote the concentration of an ionic or molecular species, we can write this as\n",
    "$$P \\propto [\\mathrm{H_2}]\\times [\\mathrm{H_2}] \\times [\\mathrm{O_2}].$$\n",
    "This statement is the law of mass action, it states that the rate of any chemical reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reactants.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the rate of collisions between reactants is proportional to their concentrations, many other factors must align for a reaction to actually occur, we for example need the molecules meeting to have enough kinetic energy to overcome the energy barrier. We combine all other such factors into a single parameter, $k$, which we call the rate constant of the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the rate constant $k$ as the proportionality factor, we can now set up a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the time evolution of the different concentrations. As we have three molecular species, we get three ODEs, and these are:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d [H_2 O]}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2k\\mathrm{[H_2]^2}\\mathrm{[O_2]}, \\qquad \\frac{\\mathrm{d [H_2]}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2k\\mathrm{[H_2]^2}\\mathrm{[O_2]}, \\qquad \\frac{\\mathrm{d [O_2]}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k\\mathrm{[H_2]^2}\\mathrm{[O_2]}.$$\n",
    "By setting up these ODEs, we have created a mathematical model of our chemical reaction, and by solving the ODEs we model the reaction over time. To do so, we would need a specific value of the rate constant $k$. This parameter must be measured in an empirical experiment in the lab. Experiments like these have been carried out for more or less any conceivable reaction and tabulated, so we can look them up as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we call $k$ a rate *constant* because it doesn't change with the concentrations of the reactants, however, it might very well change throughout the reaction for other reasons, such as changes in temperature or pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature dependence of the rate constant is described by the [Arrhenius equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation), which states that the rate has an exponential dependency on temperature:\n",
    "$$k = Ae^{-E_{\\rm barrier}/k_{\\rm B}T}.$$\n",
    "For most reactions occurring within a biological system, the temperature is constant, and so we often don't need to include temperature driven shits in rates. However, often experiments carried out in a lab are not carried out at the same temperature as those seen *in situ*, and so rates often need to be scaled with respect to temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Points:\n",
    "* The law of mass action states that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reactants\n",
    "* The proportionality factor is the *rate constant*, often written as a lower-case $k$\n",
    "* It is called the rate *constant* because it does not vary with the concentrations of the reactants, it might vary with other conditions such as temperature\n",
    "* From the law of mass action we can set up a system of ODEs governing the time evolution of the system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the ODE System\n",
    "\n",
    "We now turn to solving the ODE system we have set up, to find the concentration of the three different species over time. This is covered in the accompanying notebook:\n",

    "## Chemical Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "In our combustion example, we modeled the chemical reaction as a one-way reaction. This is reasonable for a reaction such as this combustion, because the gases react and produce water, but the reverse doesn't happen to any noticeable extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many reactions will occur in both directions, especially so for a closed system, such as the inside of a cell. As an example, let us look at an example. Myoglobin is a protein that can bind oxygen gas molecules to it. Each myoglobin protein can bind a single oxygen molecule to it. However, if we have a concentration of myoglobin and oxygen gas in a closed container, individual myoglobin molecules will continuously be binding and releasing oxygen. The binding reaction can be written as \n",
    "$$\\mathrm{Mb} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\underset{k_-}{\\overset{k_+}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{MbO_2}.$$\n",
    "Note that we have replaced the single one-way arrow with a pair that point in either directions. We say that oxygen binding to a free myoglobin is the *forward* direction of the reaction, which progresses with the forward rate $k_+$, while the reverse reaction occurs at the rate of $k_-$. These two rates are in general different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the concentrations of the two species, the total system will reach some net equilibrium were the total amount of bound oxygen doesn't change. We will use the law of mass action to find this equilibrium. Using the law of mass action, we can set up the ODE\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\rm d[MbO_2]}{{\\rm d}t} = k_+[\\mathrm{Mb}][\\mathrm{O_2}] - k_-[\\mathrm{MbO_2}].$$\n",
    "As we are looking for an equilibrium, we can set the time derivative to zero, as by definition, the net concentrations do not change at equilibrium. We then have\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\rm d[MbO_2]}{{\\rm d}t} = k_+[\\mathrm{Mb}][\\mathrm{O_2}] - k_-[\\mathrm{MbO_2}] = 0 \\quad (\\text{at equilibrium}).$$\n",
    "From this equation, we can easily see that \n",
    "$$k_+ [\\mathrm{Mb}][\\mathrm{O_2}] = k_-[\\mathrm{MbO_2}] \\quad (\\text{at equilibrium}).$$\n",
    "This expression tells us that the amount of oxygen binding and being released from myoglobin must be the same at any given time if the system is at equilibrium. This makes sense, as this is the precise reason why we are at equilibrium, nothing is really changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our equilibrium expression, we can note that the ratio of concentrations will be constant at equilibrium:\n",
    "$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{Mb}][\\mathrm{O_2}]}{[\\mathrm{MbO_2}]} = \\frac{k_-}{k_+} = K_{\\rm d}.$$\n",
    "As the two rate constants are exactly that, constants, we denote their ratio as $K_{\\rm d}$, called the *dissociation constant* of the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium formula tells us that the ratio of the free species to the oxygen-bound complex is simply given by the ratio of the rate constants, at equilibrium. Thus, if the forward and reverse rates change by the same amount, the equilibrium balance will be unchanged, but if one changes in relation to the other, the equilibrium balance will shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MbO$_2$ complex 'breaking' up into its separate Mb and O$_2$ components is called the *dissociation* of the complex. This is why we call the equilibrium constant $K_{\\rm d}$ the dissociation constant, as it says something about how likely we are to find the MbO$_2$ complex dissociated. Sometimes the dissociation constant is referred to as the equilibrium constant and denoted $K_{\\rm eq}$ or simply $K$, however, *equilibrium* isn't saying anything about the direction of the reaction, and so could also denote the inverse relation, $k_{+}/k_{-}$ (which would be the *binding*, or *association*, constant). There doesn't seem to be any strict conventions here, so some care should be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important points\n",
    "* Most chemical reactions are reversible, and can proceed in either forward or reverse direction\n",
    "* The forward and reverse directions have separate, and different, rate constants\n",
    "* At chemical equilibrium, the rates of the two directions balance out, and concentrations do not change\n",
    "* Equilibrium can be characterized by the dissociation constant, which is the ratio of the two rate constants $K_{\\rm d} = k_-/k_-.$"

    "## Gibb's Free Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now go over a more theoretical concept of thermodynamics, *Gibb's Free Energy*. If you are not already familiar with the concept, it might be a bit confusing at first, but it is the thermodynamic underpinning of more or less everything that occurs in a cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing the law of mass action, we stated that the chemical reaction occurs spontaneously because the chemical energy of the reactants was reduced as a result of the reaction. This is however quite an imprecise statement, that doesn't really cover the whole picture. In fact, it is only true if the reaction were to happen completely isolated from the rest of the world. For a reacting system that interacts with an environment, it is rather the *Gibb's free energy* that is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2. law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy in the universe always increases over time, and it is this that is the driving force in chemical reactions. Put simply, a reaction will occur spontaneously if it increases the total entropy in the universe. If it would lower the net entropy, it cannot happen. However, it is not only the net change of entropy in the reaction itself that is important, but also the entropy the reacting system gives or takes from its surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reacting system can exchange energy and entropy with its surrounding either through heat or through mechanical energy in the form of changes in volume. The Gibb's free energy of any current state of a reacting system is a combination of the internal energy of the system, it's mechanical interaction with the environment, and it's thermal interaction with the environment (which again is dependent on the systems internal entropy). It is given by\n",
    "$$G = U + pV - TS.$$\n",
    "Here, $G$ is Gibb's energy, $U$, $V$ and $S$ are the internal energy, the volume and the entropy of the reacting system, and $p$ and $T$ are the pressure and the temperature of the surrounding environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a reaction, the internal energy can change, the volume of the system can change and the entropy of the system can change. Any change in the pressure or temperature however, can be neglected, because we assume the surrounding environment to be much larger than the reacting system. Thus, the total change in Gibb's energy is\n",
    "$$\\Delta G = \\Delta U + p\\Delta V - T\\Delta S.$$\n",
    "Here, $\\Delta U$ is the internal (mass energy, chemical energy, other internal potential energy) energy change, $p\\Delta V$ is the mechanical energy that the system exchanges with the surroundings, and $T\\Delta S$ is the thermal energy the system exchanges with its surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is it called \"free\" energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Gibb's free energy is known by many names, some call it just Gibb's energy. Others call it Gibb's function, or free enthalpy. Originally it was known as Gibb's *available* energy. Put simply, it's a measure of how much energy can be extracted as useful work in a reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good metaphor for Gibb's energy is found in Schroeder's *An introduction to Thermal Physics*. Imagine a wizard conjures up a rabbit from nothing. Obviously the wizard has to follow the laws of thermodynamics, which states that energy cannot be created. How much energy would the wizard have to supply to create the rabbit? First of, the wizard has to supply the internal energy of the rabbit $U$. This encompasses all the mass energy and the chemical energy. If the rabbit were to be created in an isolated vacuum, this would be the end of it. However, to get the rabbit to pop right into existence in front of you, the wizard actually has to make space for the rabbit by pushing some air aside, which would cost some mechanical energy. This cost would be $pV$, the higher the air pressure and the bigger the rabbit, the more work has to be performed. The energy cost is now $U + pV$. However, the wizard is quite clever, and so he can save some energy as well. If he conjures up a cold rabbit, he knows the laws of thermodynamics says heat will spontaneously flow from the high temperature surrounding into the low temperature rabbit, so the magician can subtract this energy from his energy bill. This contribution is $TS$, where $S$ is the entropy of the rabbit. Why does the entropy enter into it? Because temperature is defined as derivative $T = \\delta U/\\delta S$. So the more entropy the rabbit has, the more thermal energy it will absorb from its environment. So the energy bill of the wizard is the Gibb's energy $U + pV - TS$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/gibbs_rabbit.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if Gibb's energy can be thought of as an energy 'bill', shouldn't it be called the Gibb's *costly* energy? Well, the name comes from the reversed process. If an evil wizard were to annihilate a rabbit and extract as much energy as possible in the process, they would first get all the internal energy, and then some added mechanical work from the surrounding air collapsing into the resulting vacuum. However, they would have to dump some of that energy as heat into the environment, otherwise the net entropy in the universe would decrease, which would break the 2. law. So the Gibb's free (or available) energy is simply the amount of energy the system can release if it were to stop existing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Change of Gibb's energy in a reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, in the real world, a system doesn't just stop existing. But in a chemical reaction, we can think of it as one system being annihilated, and one being created. The change in their Gibb's energy is the important quantity\n",
    "$$\\Delta G = \\Delta U + p\\Delta V - T\\Delta S.$$\n",
    "If $\\Delta G < 0$, the reaction will occur spontaneously. If $\\Delta G > 0$, the reaction will occur spontaneously in the reverse direction. While if $\\Delta G = 0$ we are at equilibrium. If a reaction occurs with a net decrease in Gibb's energy $\\Delta G$, this is also the maximum amount of useful work that can be extracted from the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any molecular species, we can express its Gibb's free energy as\n",
    "$$G = G^0 + RT \\ln c.$$\n",
    "Where the first term, $G^0$, is called the standard free energy, which is dependent on what chemical species is being discussed, but not the concentrations involved. The second term is dependent on the concentration of the species, but is otherwise inconsiderate of what the species is. Here, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ the temperature and $c$ the concentration of the species.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a reaction occurs where A $\\to$ B, the net change in Gibb's energy can be expressed as\n",
    "$$\\Delta G = \\Delta G^0 + RT \\ln \\frac{c_{\\rm B}}{c_{\\rm A}}.$$\n",
    "Note that the change in Gibb's energy can be written as two terms. The first is the change in standard free energy, which depends on what molecular species are interacting. This value is tabulated for most molecular species under standard conditions. The second term only cares about the ratio of the concentrations of the species, and so is not specific to what reaction is occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chemical Equilibrium from Gibb's energy\n",
    "\n",
    "At equilibrium, we know that $\\Delta G = 0$, otherwise a spontaneous reaction would occur, so we then see that\n",
    "$$\\frac{c_{\\rm B}}{c_{\\rm A}} = e^{-\\Delta G^0/RT}.$$\n",
    "This means that if we know the change in standard free energy for some reaction or process, we can find the concentration ratio at equilibrium. This will be useful in the next session when we look at the cell membrane.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gibb's energy is a useful concept that combines energy and entropy considerations that are important in thermodynamics\n",
    "* Nature wants to minimize Gibb's energy, and so a reaction or process will occur spontaneously when $\\Delta G < 0$\n",
    "* Gibb's energy becomes minimized at equilibrium, meaning a reaction will have $\\Delta G=0$ at chemical equilibrium"

    "\n",
    "We shall now look at a phenomenon known as cooperativity, which will lead to the *Hill Equation*, an important equation to model some biological reactions. But before we get to that discussion, we will briefly return to our example of oxygen binding to myoglobin.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Oxygen binding to Myoglobin\n",
    "\n",
    "In our earlier discussion, we found that the reaction\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{Mb} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\underset{k_-}{\\overset{k_+}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{MbO_2}.$$\n",

    "i.e., the fraction of all myoglobin molecules that will have oxygen bound to it. To simplify, we only care about the fraction that will be bound at equilibrium.\n",

    "While this expression looks messy, note that we can simplify it considerably. We can divide out the $[\\mathrm{Mb}]$ factor, as it is common to all terms. And we extend the fraction by $K_{\\rm d}$. The result is the much neater expression:\n",
    "$$Y = \\frac{[\\mathrm{O_2}]}{[\\mathrm{O_2}] + K_{\\rm d}}.$$\n",
    "We have now found the fraction of myoglobin that will have oxygen-bound to it, as a function of the free oxygen available. Let us look at how the function looks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/fractional_oxygenation.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot shows the proportion of myoglobin proteins that will have oxygen bound to it, at different levels of oxygenation. If there is no oxygen available, there will be no oxygen bound to the Myoglobin. As some oxygen is added to the system, some myoglobin will start binding oxygen. When the concentration of oxygen reaches the dissociation constant $[{\\rm O}_2] = K_{\\rm d}$, we see half the myoglobin proteins will bind oxygen. In this scenario, the $K_{\\rm d}$ is thus a measure of half-saturation. As the oxygen levels rise further, the curve starts to level out. Note that even at high levels of oxygen, the degree of oxygenation never fully reaches 1. This means that even if there is a lot of oxygen available, there will always be some amount of myoglobin that does not currently have oxygen bound to it."

However, in experiments looking at myoglobin and hemoglobin they act very differently, defying this intuition. The problem, it turns out, is that the four binding sites of an individual hemoglobin are not acting independently of each other, like four myoglobins in a solution would.

This is called *cooperative binding*, as the binding sites seem to be cooperating with each other.\n",

This is because hemoglobin can, and will, often bind only 1, 2, or 3 oxygen molecules, that just makes it more likely to bind even more. When fitting the experimental curve, we find that hemoglobin fits very well to the Hill curve, but with $n=3$ instead of 4. Thus the Hill equation isn't strictly speaking a measure of the number of units cooperating (even though it will be stated as such in some texts), rather, it is a measure of how much cooperation there is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we can say that $n = 1$ means no cooperation and $n > 1$ means there is some cooperation. The larger $n$ is, the stronger the cooperation. We can also have $n < 1$, this is called negative cooperation. For a binding reaction, negative cooperation would mean binding to one site inhibits binding to other sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the Hill coefficient can even be fractional, it turns out that if you fit the curve of oxygen binding to hemoglobin to good data, the best fit is actually given by an $n$ equal to 3.1. This fractional Hill coefficient doesn't really make sense if we try to interpret it as the exact number of binding sites, but if we think of it more as a phenomenological parameter trying to catch the cooperativity phenomenon, it makes perfect sense.

    "\n",
    "Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for biochemical reactions, meaning they speed up the reactions, without being consumed in the process. There are many different mechanisms an enzyme can do this, but we won't go into the mechanistic details of it now. Instead, we want to make a simplified and understandable model of how enzymes work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzymes generally work by somehow lowering the energy barrier of a chemical reaction. This can for example be achieved by binding to an intermediate state in the reaction. Recall now Arrhenius' law, which stated that the rate constant of a reaction could be written as\n",
    "$$k = Ae^{-E_{\\rm barrier}/k_{\\rm B}T}.$$\n",
    "This relation tells us that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the exponential of the activation energy. Thus, even a relatively small reduction in the energy barrier of a given reaction can cause a huge change in reaction speed. Because of this, enzymes are usually highly efficient and can speed up reactions by many orders of magnitude ($>10^7$ in some cases!). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/activation_barrier_enzyme.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The drastic change in reaction speed due to enzymes is hugely important for cellular function. We can effectively have reacting systems in the cell that have a rate so slow that they are effectively stable, but as soon as a bit of enzyme is added, things start happening. In this sense, enzymes can be thought of as on-buttons for various processes in the cell that are lying in standby. An example of this is the energy carrier molecules ATP. These molecules carry a fair bit of chemical energy, and so will spontaneously dissociate and release energy. However, the rate of this dissociation is very slow, and so it takes a very long time for ATP to dissociate on its own. The cell can therefore produce ATP through metabolism and let it sit for a while, without fear of wasting energy. Molecular machines can now be equipped with enzymes that speed up the dissociation of ATP, harnessing some of the released energy in the process. These enzymatic machines are known as *ATPases*, and we will see some of examples of these later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enzymes change reaction speed, not direction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that an enzyme can never change the net change in Gibb's energy in a reaction, and will therefore never be able to change the direction of a reaction. An enzyme cannot trigger a reaction that is not spontaneous on its own, it can just speed it up. The upside however, is that the enzyme molecules doesn't get used up in the reaction, and therefore even a small amount of enzyme is usually enough to trigger some process."

    "\n",
    "The exact action of enzymes can vary a lot, and can be challenging to explore properly due to their specific nature and the complexity of large proteins. For example, the exact way the enzyme *catalase* works remains elusive, despite it being common to more or less all life that processes oxygen. So we won't try to model *how* an enzyme works, but instead what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now look at how we can model the activity of an enzyme with a simple model. While simple, this model is incredibly useful, and sees a  lot of use in physiological modeling. As it is a simplified model with some underlying assumptions, it is often referred to as first-order kinetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzymes work by binding to some molecule, the *substrate*, converting it, and then releasing the *product*. We therefore propose the following reaction to model this activity\n",
    "$${\\rm S} + {\\rm E} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\overset{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} {\\rm ES} \\overset{k_2}{\\rightarrow} {\\rm E} + {\\rm P}.$$\n",
    "Here S is the substrate that is to be converted and E is the enzyme, these can bind together and form an enzyme-substrate complex, ES. The ES complex can either break up again without converting the substrate, or the substrate can be converted and the complex breaks up into a free enzyme molecule and a product molecule, P. We assume that once the product has been released by the enzyme, it no longer binds to the enzyme spontaneously, so there is no reverse arrow in the final reaction."

    "$$v = \\dot{[{\\rm P}]} = k_2[{\\rm ES}],$$\n",

    "### Enzyme Inhibition\n",
    "\n",
    "Another class of molecules are the enzyme inhibitors. These are molecules that reduce, or completely shut of, the activity of enzymes. There are different functional ways for inhibitors to work, but the simplest mechanism is simply binding to enzyme more readily than the actual substrate, but then not actually converting to anything. Thus the enzymes waste their binding time on the inhibitors rather than the substrate. Enzyme inhibition is another important tool in the cell for regulating behavior, and many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. An example of this is penicillin, which inhibits an enzyme bacteria need for cell wall synthesis, eventually killing the bacteria as it is unable to maintain its own cell wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending the Michaelis-Menten model to include enzyme inhibitors is quite easy, we simply add the inhibitor as a new species $I$, and new reactions to the system where the inhibitor can bind to the enzyme. It then turns out we can make slightly different models, depending on where the inhibitor binds. These different models would behave differently in practice. When comparing to experiment, it turns out that the different models correspond to different inhibitors, and so in practice, different enzyme inhibitors are grouped into different classes. The figure below shows how the Michaelis-Menten model would be extended for each of these groups. \n",

    "<img src=\"fig/enzyme_inhibition.png\" width=800>\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these cases, we could go through our analysis again, setting up the kinetics from the law of mass action, assume equilibrium and quasi-static conditions, and find expressions for the first-order enzyme kinetics. While we won't go through all the algebra here, the model predictions we end up with agree well with experiment, and are often very useful in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, the Michaelis-Menten model is quite simple, but surprisingly powerful, the fact that it can so easily be extende to include the effects of inhibitors is another reason it is so often used in biomedical modeling.\n",
